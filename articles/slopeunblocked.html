            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>If you’re into fast-paced, skill-based games, <em>Slope Unblocked</em> is a must-play. This addictive
                endless runner puts you in control of a rolling ball as you speed down a neon-lit slope filled with
                deadly obstacles. It’s simple to play but brutally hard to master — and that’s what makes it so popular.
            </p>
            <p>Whether you’re on a school Chromebook or just looking to kill time at work, <a
                    href="https://rycellgames.github.io/games/slope">Slope Unblocked’</a> offers intense, lag-free fun
                that requires nothing more than a web browser. Here’s everything you need to know.</p>
            <h2 id="what-is-slope-unblocked">What Is Slope Unblocked?</h2>
            <p><em>Slope Unblocked</em> is a free online game where you guide a ball down a never-ending 3D slope. As
                you descend, the ball picks up speed, the slope tilts in random directions, and the game throws red
                blocks and sharp turns at you with little to no warning.</p>
            <p>Because it’s unblocked, it can be played at school, work, or anywhere firewalls typically restrict gaming
                sites. No downloads, no accounts — just click and play.</p>
            <h2 id="how-to-play">How to Play</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Controls</strong>:<br>
                        Use the <strong>left and right arrow keys</strong> (or <strong>A/D keys</strong>) to steer the
                        ball. There’s no jumping or stopping — the ball constantly rolls forward, so your job is to
                        react fast and avoid falling off.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Objective</strong>:<br>
                        Stay on the track as long as possible while dodging obstacles and surviving tight turns.</p>

                <li>
                    <p><strong>Game Over</strong>:<br>
                        One wrong move — whether it’s hitting a red block or falling off the edge — and it’s game over.
